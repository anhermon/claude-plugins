## Use Cases

### 1. Creating Sub-Agents

**Scenario**: You want a specialized agent for security reviews

**How to Use**:
```
Just ask: "Create a sub-agent for security code reviews"

The meta-agent will:
- Fetch latest documentation
- Ask clarifying questions
- Generate the agent configuration
- Write to ~/.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md
- Provide usage instructions
```

---

### 2. Creating Slash Commands

**Scenario**: You frequently deploy to production and want a shortcut

**How to Use**:
```
Just ask: "Create a slash command for deploying to production"

The meta-command agent will:
- Fetch latest documentation
- Study existing command patterns
- Generate the command prompt
- Write to ~/.claude/commands/deploy.md
- Show usage examples
```

---

### 3. Creating Skills

**Scenario**: You work with Excel files and want Claude to be better at it

**How to Use**:
```
Just ask: "Create a skill for Excel spreadsheet work"

The meta-skill agent will:
- Fetch latest documentation
- Generate SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
- Set up model-invoked triggering
- Write to ~/.claude/skills/excel-expert/
- Explain how it will be triggered
```

---

### 4. Creating Plugins

**Scenario**: You want to package your team's code review tools

**How to Use**:
```
Just ask: "Create a plugin for our team code review workflow"

The meta-plugin agent will:
- Fetch latest documentation
- Ask what components to include
- Generate PLUGIN.md and README.md
- Create all components
- Provide installation instructions
```

---

### 5. Spawning New Sessions

**Scenario**: You want to work on a different task in parallel

**How to Use**:
```bash
/spawn Optimize the database queries --agent performance-reviewer
```

Opens a new terminal with Claude already focused on optimization!

---

### 6. Interactive Entity Creation

**Scenario**: You're not sure what type of extension you need

**How to Use**:
```bash
/create-entity
```

Wizard walks you through choosing the right type and creating it!

---

### 7. Executing Tasks with Different AI Models

**Scenario**: You want to compare how different models approach a problem or delegate to model-specific strengths

**How to Use**:
```bash
# Use Claude for deep code analysis
/execute-with-model --model claude "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"

# Use Gemini for research
/execute-with-model --model gemini "Find latest React best practices"

# Use Codex for code generation
/execute-with-model --model codex "Generate a REST API in Python"
```

Benefits:
- Leverage model-specific strengths
- Run multiple tasks in parallel with different models
- Compare outputs for consensus building
- Isolate long-running tasks in background sessions

---

## Configuration

No configuration needed! The plugin works out of the box.

All meta-agents automatically fetch the latest documentation from:
- Sub-agents: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
- Slash commands: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands
- Skills: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills
- Plugins: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins

## Troubleshooting

### Meta-agents not being invoked proactively

**Issue**: You asked to create something but the meta-agent didn't activate

**Solution**: Try being more explicit:
- "Create a sub-agent for X"
- "Generate a slash command for Y"
- "Make a skill for Z"

Or use the /create-entity command for interactive creation.

### Documentation fetch fails

**Issue**: Meta-agent can't fetch latest docs

**Solution**: Check internet connection. The agents will fall back to built-in knowledge if fetch fails.

### Created entity not working

**Issue**: Entity was created but doesn't work as expected

**Solution**: Check the created file for:
- Valid YAML frontmatter
- Correct file location
- Proper naming (kebab-case)
- Restart Claude Code to pick up new entities

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Testing Agent

**Request**:
```
Create a sub-agent that helps me write unit tests for Python code
```

**What Happens**:
1. meta-agent is invoked
2. Fetches latest sub-agent docs
3. Studies existing examples
4. Creates `~/.claude/agents/python-test-writer.md`
5. Reports success with usage instructions

**Result**: New agent available for test writing!

---

### Example 2: Create a Git Command

**Request**:
```
Create a slash command that commits and pushes with one command
```

**What Happens**:
1. meta-command is invoked
2. Fetches latest slash command docs
3. Studies existing patterns
4. Creates `~/.claude/commands/git-ship.md`
5. Shows usage examples

**Result**: `/git-ship` command ready to use!

---

### Example 3: Create a React Skill

**Request**:
```
Create a skill for React component best practices
```

**What Happens**:
1. meta-skill is invoked
2. Fetches latest skills docs
3. Creates `~/.claude/skills/react-patterns/SKILL.md`
4. Sets up auto-invocation triggers

**Result**: Skill automatically loads when working with React!

---

### Example 4: Package Team Tools

**Request**:
```
Create a plugin with our code review agent and commands
```

**What Happens**:
1. meta-plugin is invoked
2. Fetches latest plugin docs
3. Asks what components to include
4. Creates complete plugin structure
5. Generates PLUGIN.md and README

**Result**: Shareable plugin package ready for team!

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Meta-Agent

- **meta-agent**: For reusable, specialized AI functionality
- **meta-command**: For frequently-used manual workflows
- **meta-skill**: For automatic expertise Claude should invoke
- **meta-plugin**: For packaging multiple components together

### Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear requirements when asking for creation
2. **Review Output**: Always review generated configurations
3. **Iterate**: Created entities can be manually edited and improved
4. **Follow Patterns**: Study generated examples to learn best practices
5. **Share**: Package useful creations as plugins for your team

### Leveraging Proactive Features

- Let meta-agents activate automatically - just describe what you want
- Use the unified meta-creator skill for guidance
- Try /create-entity for interactive, wizard-style creation
- Use /spawn for parallel work on different tasks
