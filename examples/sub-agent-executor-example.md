# DEPRECATED - This Example is No Longer Relevant

The `sub-agent-executor` agent has been deprecated. Its functionality is now provided by:

- **`/meta-tools:spawn`** - For launching new interactive Claude Code sessions in terminal windows
- **`/meta-tools:prompt`** - For executing prompts with AI models and returning results

Please refer to the command examples instead:
- See `/meta-tools:spawn` command documentation
- See `/meta-tools:prompt` command documentation
